### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Manjunath**](https://myvoyage-v1.vercel.app/), a software engineer based in Bangalore.

I love blending my technical skills with design to craft elegant and efficient applications. My aim is to build scalable software solutions that deliver both engaging and seamless user experiences.

Beyond work, I’m passionate about deepening my knowledge in both the tech world and sports, especially cricket. I also enjoy working on various side projects, most of which are in private repositories.

#### Fun Facts:
- I don't like coffee and hence I'm not addicted to coffee.
- Ben 10 is my favorite anime.
- MCU is ❤️ 
- I love using Nextjs x Typescript after switching from Reactjs x Javascript.
