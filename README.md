### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Manjunath**](https://myvoyage-v1.vercel.app/), a software engineer based in Bangalore.

I enjoy combining my technical expertise with design to create beautiful and efficient applications. My goal is to develop scalable software solutions that offer engaging and seamless user experiences.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about expanding my knowledge in the tech world and sports(cricket). I also work on several side projects (most of them are in private repositories).

#### Fun Facts:
- I don't like coffee and hence I'm not addicted to coffee.
- Ben 10 is my favorite anime.
- MCU is ❤️ 
- I love using Nextjs x Typescript after switching from Reactjs x Javascript.
